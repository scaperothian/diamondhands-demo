One of the challenges faced by the team at mydiamondhands.io while researching, exploring, developing and extracting our datasets has been understanding the unique and specific terminology associated with crypto, such as Gas Prices, Wei, Gwei, Smart Contract, Uniswap, Blockchain, etc. To help overcome some of the challenges, and ensure that at a minimum there is a commonly accepted definition amongst our development team, we have created a Data Dictionary, which looks to define terms, and also highlight our conceptual understanding of relevance. The entire data dictionary is warehoused in our [Github Repository,](https://github.com/derek-dewald/DATASCI210/tree/main/Data_Dictionary) a few examples have been provided below to provide a quick summary and searchable values for the site.
