In order to get a bound on the predictions of an ML model, a conformer approach for putting confidence bounds on the data is described.

For linear models, there are well known approaches to acquiring confidence intervals.

There are several different approaches to putting confidence intervals on prediction results \[1\]\[2\]\[3\].  In this article we will explore one of the approaches.
