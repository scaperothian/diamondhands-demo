The team is composed of 4 crypto enthusiasts (1 long term believer and 3 recent converts), who appreciate the simplicity (while concurrently marvelling in the complex mathematical sophistication underlying the cryptography) and believe in the transformative possibility of the technology. We started [mydiamondhands.io](http://mydiamondhands.io/) with the mission statement of: Educating retail investors on the transformative opportunity of crypto and providing them access to an arbitrage model which serves to build confidence and engagement in crypto currency markets.

To bring our mission to fruition, we have identified 3 guiding principles:

1) Education over Enrichment

2) Simplicity over Sophistication

3) Community over Competition.

These principles are used to guide decision making, to ensure that we retain integrity, consistency and never lose focus on our goal of positively contributing to the crypto community.

A site disclaimer, would be that none of the individuals in this group are licensed to provide, offer or recommend financial instruments in any way shape or form. This information and the information within the site should not be considered unique financial advice and if you consider utilizing the model, or investing in crypto you should first seek financial advice from a trained professional, to ensure that you fully understand the risk. Further, while modelling efforts have been undertaken in an effort to avoid risk through the application of the principles of arbitrage, the model has not been empirically tested, and should be approached with extreme caution, care and be utilized at one's own risk (do not make trades to which you would be unable to fulfill, or would be in a detrimental financial position if it was to not complete as expected).
